# Takaful 🌍

**Takaful** is a humanitarian platform created in response to the crisis in Gaza. It connects people in need with supporters who want to help. The platform allows individuals to securely submit aid requests, and supporters to make donations — all while protecting the privacy of those seeking help.

## Usage

Takaful supports two user roles:

### 1. Request Help (Submit a Case) 🆘

People in need can:

- Register for an account
- Submit a private aid request (case)
- Attach documents and details describing their situation

> **Note:** All submitted cases are completely private and only visible to the platform administrators. Other users cannot view or browse cases submitted by others.

---

### 2. Donate as a Supporter 💖

Supporters can:

- Access a donation page
- Make secure donations toward general aid (e.g., food, shelter, medical needs)
- Support the community without accessing private case data

> **Supporters do not see individual cases** — all donations are directed through verified internal channels to protect recipients' dignity and privacy.
