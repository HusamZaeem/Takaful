# Takaful 🌍

## Usage

Takaful supports two primary user roles:

### 1. Request Help (Submit a Case) 🆘

People who are in need of assistance can:

- Register for an account on the platform
- Submit a private aid request (case) detailing their situation
- Attach relevant documents to support their request

> **Note:** All submitted cases are completely private and only visible to platform administrators. Other users cannot view or browse the cases submitted by others. This ensures that the platform maintains the dignity and privacy of those seeking help.

---

### 2. Donate as a Supporter 💖

Supporters can:

- Access a donation page
- Make secure donations to contribute toward general aid (e.g., food, shelter, medical needs)
- Support the community without accessing private case data

> **Supporters do not see individual cases** — all donations are directed through verified internal channels, which helps maintain the privacy and dignity of those receiving assistance.

---

## Technologies Used

Takaful is built using the following technologies:

- **Laravel** – A powerful PHP framework for backend development
- **Laravel Breeze** – Lightweight authentication scaffolding for Laravel
- **Blade** – Templating engine to create dynamic views and layouts
- **MySQL** – Relational database for managing users and case submissions
